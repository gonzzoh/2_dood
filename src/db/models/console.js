/**
 * WHAT IS THIS FILE?
 *
 * Sometimes you just want to mess around with models before you get into the
 * server. In those cases, it can be a pain to keep making playground files for
 * little things. This file lets you use a REPL to mess around
 *
 * For Top level awaits and fetches, make sure you're on node 18.0.0 or higher.
 * (This model has no DB so needs no awaits, that's just a heads up)
